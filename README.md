<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm C√©dric Bohnert !</h1>
<h2 align="center">An Aspiring Data & Machine Learning Scientist from France</h3>

<h3 align="center">About Me:</h3>

- üî≠ My main goal for 2024 is to work towards **leveling up my software development skills and building up my GitHub profile with notes and projects.**

  Specifically, I am studying for 2024 in order to complete a [Bachelor D√©veloppeur d'Application Python](https://www.studi.com/fr/formation/developpement/bachelor-developpeur-dapplication-python) with the online school STUDI. It is a french level 6 RNCP title of Software Developer. With this Bachelor, I will be equiped with 3 sets of skills: 1. conception and specification of the digital solution, 2. management, piloting and testing of the digital solution, and 3. python development of the digital solution. When completed, I will move toward Data Science and AI.

- üå± During the summer of 2024, I will be learning **the principles of good software construction aka. software engineering in order to master software development.**

  I am using several good resources in order to complete that phase of upskilling. I am currently learning from the STUDI platform and [www.educative.io](https://www.educative.io). More specifically, I am currently learning from the great 'Learn to Code: Become a Software Engineer' skill path from Educative. 

- üëØ I‚Äôm currently open to collaborate on **upskilling with anyone who loves to learn about Python Programming, Data Science and AI.**

- ü§ù My favorite domain applications of AI are **STEM Education, Research & Development and Healthcare.**

  A current side project is the development of a small online Body Roundness Index Calculator dedicated to France population and medical practicioners. BRI is a new anthopometric measure assessing fat distribution to decipher the population-based characteristics and potential association with mortality risk. This is still a work in progress and you can use a first Minimum Viable Product at [www.calcule-ton-irc.fr](https://www.calcule-ton-irc.fr). It is yet a 100% Front End App written with the help of Bootstrap 5.

- üë®‚Äçüíª My main projects portfolio website (please note it is a work in progress) is available at [https://cbohnert67.github.io](https://cbohnert67.github.io).

- üí¨ Ask me about **anything data-science related, and I'll be happy to help you out. I love talking about this!**

- üì´ How to reach me: **cbohnert.datascience@gmail.com**

- ‚ö° Fun fact: **When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to electro music while walking in the city of Strasbourg, France.**
