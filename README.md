<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm C√©dric Bohnert !</h1>
<h2 align="center">An Aspiring Data & Machine Learning Scientist from France</h3>

- üî≠ My main goal for 2024 is to work towards **leveling up my software development skills and building up my GitHub profile with notes and projects.**

  Specifically, I am studying for 2024 in order to complete a [Bachelor D√©veloppeur d'Application Python](https://www.studi.com/fr/formation/developpement/bachelor-developpeur-dapplication-python) with the online school STUDI. It is a french level 6 RNCP title of Software Developer. With this Bachelor, I will be equiped with 3 sets of skills: 1. conception and specification of the digital solution, 2. management, piloting and testing of the digital solution, and 3. python development of the digital solution. When completed, I will move toward Data Science and AI.

- üå± During the summer of 2024, I will be learning **the principles of good software construction aka. software engineering in order to master software development.**

  I am using several good resources in order to complete that phase of upskilling. I am currently learning from the STUDI platform and [www.educative.io](https://www.educative.io). More specifically, I am currently learning from the great 'Learn to Code: Become a Software Engineer' skill path from Educative. 

  My current readings are the following great books:
