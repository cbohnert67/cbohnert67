<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm C√©dric Bohnert !</h1>
<h2 align="center">An Aspiring AI Engineer from France</h2>
<h2 align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è Actively Looking for A Work-Study (alternance) AI Engineer Position starting in 2025 ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>

<h3 align="center">About Me:</h3>

  üî≠ My main goal in 2025 is to work towards **leveling up my Data Science and AI skills and building up my GitHub profile with notes and showcases.**

  In 2024, I have been actively focused on mastering the principles of software engineering to build a strong foundation in software development. During the latter part of the year, I have concentrated on upskilling with the help of excellent resources, including the STUDI platform and the highly challenging [www.educative.io](https://www.educative.io) learning platform.
  
  Here are the key areas I‚Äôve been focusing on:  
  
  - **Object-Oriented Programming with Python** and **Object-Oriented Design with UML.**  
  - **Algorithmic Problem Solving** and crafting efficient programs using **Data Structures.**  
  - **Relational Database Modeling and Implementation** with **SQL** and **Python ORM.**  
  - **Collaborating and Communicating with APIs and Libraries** using Python.  
  - **Software Engineering Management and Quality** practices with **Agile SCRUM.**
  
  These efforts have equipped me with a robust skill set for designing, developing, and managing software systems. I am now fully prepared to transition into learning Data Science and AI Engineering. My foundation in software development principles, problem-solving, and data modeling provides an excellent basis for exploring advanced techniques in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data-driven decision-making.
    
   üå± My new 2025 Learning Objectives: Mastering Data Science & AI
    
  - **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Master Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for insightful data exploration.
  - **Machine Learning:** Develop and evaluate models using scikit-learn; implement algorithms like regression and clustering.
  - **Deep Learning:** Gain expertise in TensorFlow and PyTorch; build neural networks for NLP and computer vision.
  - **Big Data Technologies:** Learn Hadoop and Apache Spark to handle and process large-scale datasets.
  - **Mathematics & Statistics:** Strengthen foundations in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistical modeling.
  - **Software Engineering for AI:** Enhance Python programming skills; deploy models with Docker and Kubernetes.
  - **Advanced AI Topics:** Explore Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.
  - **Projects & Collaboration:** Contribute to open-source projects and build a comprehensive data science portfolio.
  - **Certifications & Continuous Learning:** Achieve certifications in Data Science and AI; stay updated with the latest industry trends.

   üëØ I‚Äôm open to collaborate on **upskilling with anyone who loves to learn about Python Programming, Data Science and AI.**

  I‚Äôm building my skills in Python programming and Data Science with the goal of becoming an AI Engineer. As I navigate this exciting journey, I‚Äôm seeking collaborative projects on GitHub to sharpen my abilities and contribute to the community.

  If you're passionate about Machine Learning, Data Science, or AI and enjoy tackling challenging problems, let's connect! 
  
  Whether it's an open-source project, a hackathon team, or just brainstorming ideas, I‚Äôm eager to collaborate and learn together.
  
Why Collaborate with Me?

  Hands-on Python Experience: I‚Äôm continuously improving my coding skills, particularly in Python, with a focus on AI-related projects.
  
  Data-Driven Approach: My projects emphasize data science techniques, from data cleaning to predictive modeling.
  
  Growth Mindset: I‚Äôm committed to lifelong learning and am on the lookout for opportunities to grow both through coursework and real-world experience.

  I‚Äôm in pursuit of a work-study (alternance) position to support a Master‚Äôs program in AI Engineering with OpenClassrooms. This opportunity would not only help finance my education but also provide invaluable practical experience.

  Explore my GitHub profile and Portfolio, and feel free to reach me out if you‚Äôre interested in working together or if you know of any opportunities that align with my journey. 
  
  Together, we can create something impactful!

 ü§ù My favorite domain applications of AI are **STEM Education, Scientific Research & Development and Healthcare.**

  I am deeply committed to exploring how AI can be harnessed to advance STEM Education, Scientific Research & Development, and Healthcare‚Äîareas where innovation can truly change lives.

  In STEM Education, I‚Äôm interested in how AI can personalize learning experiences, making complex subjects more accessible and engaging for students of all levels. I believe that AI-driven tools can bridge educational gaps and foster a new generation of thinkers and problem solvers.

  In Scientific Research & Development, my focus is on using AI to accelerate discovery and innovation. From automating data analysis to generating new insights, AI has the power to transform how we conduct research, leading to breakthroughs across various scientific fields.

  In Healthcare, I‚Äôm passionate about applying AI to improve patient care, streamline medical processes, and develop predictive models that can foresee and mitigate health risks. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment plans, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.

  These domains are where I see the most potential for AI to make a meaningful impact, and I‚Äôm dedicated to working on projects that align with these goals. I‚Äôm always open to collaboration and discussion on how we can push the boundaries of AI to create solutions that truly matter.

  üë®‚Äçüíª Let‚Äôs connect and work together to drive innovation in these critical fields! üí¨

  üì´ How to reach me: **cbohnert.datascience@gmail.com**

  ‚ö° Fun fact: **When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to electro music while walking in the city of Strasbourg, France.** So, be patient when I won't call back.
