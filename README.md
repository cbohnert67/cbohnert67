<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm C√©dric Bohnert !</h1>
<h2 align="center">An Aspiring Artificial Intelligence AI Engineer from France</h3>

<h3 align="center">About Me:</h3>

- üî≠ My main goal for 2024 is to work towards **leveling up my software development skills and building up my GitHub profile with notes and projects.**

  Specifically, I am studying for 2024 in order to complete a [Bachelor D√©veloppeur d'Application Python](https://www.studi.com/fr/formation/developpement/bachelor-developpeur-dapplication-python) with the help of the online school STUDI. It is a french level 6 RNCP title of Software Developer. With such a program, I will be well equiped with 3 sets of skills: conception and specification of the digital solution, management, piloting and testing of the digital solution, and python development for the digital solution. I will be able to design and specify a computing solution to a given problem, to guide the development through each validated phases with agility and to participate in the programming of the software with the versatile Python language. Due to such a quality and the merit of Python in the field, I will next move toward Data Science and AI after the Bachelor completed. That's why I am actively looking for a specific french law contractor who can participate in the finance of the AI Engineer career path from the online school Openclassrooms.

- üå± During the summer of 2024, I will be actively learning **the principles of good software construction aka. software engineering in order to master software development.**

  I am using several good resources in order to complete that phase of upskilling. I am currently learning from the STUDI platform and the challenging [www.educative.io](https://www.educative.io) learning platform. I am currently enrolled in the great 'Learn to Code: Become a Software Engineer' skill path from Educative. Here is what the material I am focusing on during the summer:

    - Object Oriented Programming with Python and Object Oriented Design with UML.
    - Algorithmic Problem Solving and The Craf of Efficient Programs with Data Structures
    - Relational Databases Information Modeling and Implementation with SQL
    - Collaborating and Communicating with API and Libraries with Python.
    - Software Engineering Management and Quality with Agile SCRUM.
  

- üëØ I‚Äôm currently open to collaborate on **upskilling with anyone who loves to learn about Python Programming, Data Science and AI.**

  I‚Äôm currently building my skills in Python programming and Data Science with the goal of becoming an AI Engineer. As I navigate this exciting path, I‚Äôm actively seeking collaborative projects on GitHub to sharpen my abilities and contribute to the community.

  If you're passionate about Machine Learning, Data Science, or AI and enjoy tackling challenging problems, let's connect! Whether it's an open-source project, a hackathon team, or just brainstorming ideas, I‚Äôm eager to collaborate and learn together.
Why Collaborate with Me?

    Hands-on Python Experience: I‚Äôm continuously improving my coding skills, particularly in Python, with a focus on AI-related projects.
    Data-Driven Approach: My projects emphasize data science techniques, from data cleaning to predictive modeling.
    Growth Mindset: I‚Äôm committed to lifelong learning and am on the lookout for opportunities to grow, both through coursework and real-world experience.

  I‚Äôm in pursuit of a work-study (alternance) position to support my Master‚Äôs in AI Engineering from OpenClassrooms. This opportunity would not only help finance my education but also provide invaluable practical experience.

  Explore my GitHub profile and Portfolio, and feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested in working together or if you know of any opportunities that align with my journey. Together, we can create something impactful!

- ü§ù My favorite domain applications of AI are **STEM Education, Research & Development and Healthcare.**

  I am deeply committed to exploring how AI can be harnessed to advance STEM Education, Research & Development, and Healthcare‚Äîareas where innovation can truly change lives.

  In STEM Education, I‚Äôm interested in how AI can personalize learning experiences, making complex subjects more accessible and engaging for students of all levels. I believe that AI-driven tools can bridge educational gaps and foster a new generation of thinkers and problem solvers.

  In Research & Development, my focus is on using AI to accelerate discovery and innovation. From automating data analysis to generating new insights, AI has the power to transform how we conduct research, leading to breakthroughs across various scientific fields.

  In Healthcare, I‚Äôm passionate about applying AI to improve patient care, streamline medical processes, and develop predictive models that can foresee and mitigate health risks. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment plans, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.

  These domains are where I see the most potential for AI to make a meaningful impact, and I‚Äôm dedicated to working on projects that align with these goals. I‚Äôm always open to collaboration and discussion on how we can push the boundaries of AI to create solutions that truly matter.

  üë®‚Äçüíª Let‚Äôs connect and work together to drive innovation in these critical fields! üí¨
