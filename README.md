<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Cédric Bohnert !</h1>
<h2 align="center">An Aspiring Data & Machine Learning Scientist from France</h3>

- 🔭 My main goal for 2024 is to work towards **leveling up my software development skills and building up my GitHub profile with notes and projects.**

  Specifically, I am studying for 2024 in order to complete a [Bachelor Concepteur Développeur d'Applications Python](https://www.studi.com/fr/formation/developpement/bachelor-developpeur-dapplication-python) with the online school STUDI. It is a french level 6 RNCP title of Software Developer. With this Bachelor, I will be equiped with 3 sets of skills: 1. conception and specification of the digital solution, 2. management, piloting and testing of the digital solution, and 3. python development of the digital solution.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **the principles of good software construction aka. software engineering.**

  I'm taking a break with Python to learn software development best practices (along with UML) using two great Java-based books and one awesome free online course from MIT Open Learning: <a href="https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.005.1x+3T2016/about" target="_blank">MIT 6.005.1x Software Construction in Java.</a>
